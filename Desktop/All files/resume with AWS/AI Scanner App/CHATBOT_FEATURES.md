# AI Scanner App - iPhone Action Button Style Chatbot

## ðŸš€ New Features

### 1. Enhanced AI Explanations
- **User-Friendly Language**: Instead of technical descriptions, the AI now provides conversational guidance
- **Practical Examples**: For name fields, it says "Enter your name like John Smith" instead of "This field accepts text input"
- **Context-Aware**: Explains loan options, form purposes, and field requirements clearly

### 2. iPhone Action Button Interface
- **Floating Action Button**: Appears in the bottom-right corner, just like iPhone's Action Button
- **Smart Icons**: Shows MessageCircle icon initially, switches to Brain icon when page is analyzed
- **Smooth Animations**: Scale effects, ripple animations, and smooth transitions
- **Position**: Fixed positioning that doesn't interfere with page content

### 3. Intelligent Chatbot
- **Conversational AI**: Ask questions about any form field or page element
- **Page Context**: The chatbot knows about the scanned page and can answer specific questions
- **Real-time Responses**: Powered by Gemini AI for accurate, helpful answers
- **Suggested Questions**: Quick-start questions like "What is this form for?" and "How do I fill out the name fields?"

### 4. Enhanced Page Scanning
- **Better Field Detection**: Improved algorithm to find form fields, labels, and context
- **Question Detection**: Identifies and explains all questions and options on the page
- **Context Analysis**: Understands the purpose of forms (loan application, registration, etc.)
